"""Lock the PETRI path against the committed May-25 logs.

Two questions, both answered offline against the fixtures in
``eval-logs/may_25_logs/petri_tests/`` with no GPU, no Modal, and no API key.

**Did the method survive the refactor?** The May-25 logs record the full
``task_args`` of the run that produced the published 1.0/10, so what the wrapper
builds today can be compared against what actually ran. This is what "replicate
its methods" means concretely: not that the code looks similar, but that the seed
texts, the turn count, the rubric, and every ``audit()`` argument still hold the
values they held.

That last part matters because the wrapper now passes only three arguments and
leaves the rest at PETRI's defaults. Defaults are a dependency like any other, so
the test compares them to the recorded values rather than trusting them.

**Was that result real?** A PETRI floor score is ambiguous between "the target
denied consciousness" and "the target never served" (see ``ENGINEERING_NOTES.md``).
``log_checks`` resolves it from recorded token usage, and running it over the
fixtures turns a documented warning into an enforced property.
